CitiesApp

Introduction

This repository contains the source code for the CitiesApp, a web application designed to [brief description of what the app does]. Due to some access restrictions with my office system, I was unable to push the latest changes to the GitHub repository directly using Git. As a result, I opted to upload a ZIP file containing the most recent version of the code.

Reason for ZIP Upload

I was unable to push the updates to this repository via Git because of limited access to my private GitHub account on the office system. For this reason, I have uploaded the project files as a ZIP to ensure that the code is available for review, sharing, and collaboration.

Rest assured, this is only a temporary workaround, and I will resolve the access issue as soon as possible. In the meantime, please feel free to explore the contents of the ZIP file and proceed with any necessary steps.

Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

Download the ZIP file from the GitHub repository.
Extract the contents of the ZIP file to your local machine.
Open the extracted folder in your preferred IDE or text editor.
Follow any additional installation instructions (e.g., installing dependencies, setting up the environment) in this README to get the app running.
Note

If you prefer to clone the repository directly via Git, you can do so once the access issue is resolved.
Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to the project or report any issues, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request once the Git setup is fully functional.

Customization Options:
Adjust the app description based on what CitiesApp actually does.
If you have specific instructions on how to run the project, you can add those in the Installation section.
Add any other sections that might be relevant, like License, Technologies Used, etc.
How does that sound? Let me know if you need any more tweaks!
